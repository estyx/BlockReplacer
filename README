BlockReplacer - Replace your blocks at will!


Features:
 - Switch between two block id's by using a sign
 - Signs can be toggled either with redstone power or by right-clicking
 - Define vertical distance and number of blocks
 - Supports Permissions/OP (a bit untested yet, but should work)

If you have used OneBlock earlier and dont want to set it all up again? Don't despair.
Set the signIdentifier in config.yml to '[OneBlock]' and you're good to go.
------------

Usage:

Line0: [br]     # identifier (customizable)
Line1: 2;4      # vertical distance, length (optional)
Line2: 49       # block id when sign is activated
Line3: 89       # block id when sign is deactivated
------------

Config:

(str) signIdentifier - Identifier used by plugin in first line of a sign
(str) presetIdentifier - Same as signIdentifier, but used for preset functions (TODO/NOT IN USE)
(bol) enablePresets - Whether to enable preset functions or not (TODO/NOT IN USE)
(bol) enablePlayerClick - Whether a sign activates when a player right-clicks on a BlockReplacer sign or not
